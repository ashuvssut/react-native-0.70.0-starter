### How this starter project is opinionated?

This Project has a Opinionated Project Structure. It uses TypeScript by default. It does not allows any JavaScript .js or .jsx Files. It uses absolute import statements only(See [tsconfig.json](./tsconfig.json) and [babel.config.js](./babel.config.js)).

This Project already has Firebase Auth Setup with login screens (Using Phone Number). It uses React Native Paper for themeing.

This Project uses the packages mentioned below. These packages are already configured for you. Read their respective docs to change configurations.

   - redux-flipper: 2.0.2
   - react-native-flipper: 0.162.0

2. For State management and storage
   - @reduxjs/toolkit: 1.8.5
   - redux-persist: 6.0.0
   - react-redux: 8.0.2
   - @react-native-async-storage/async-storage: 1.17.10

### Known Problems
- Right now this starter template is only tested for android. **This starter template is not tested for iOS. It will need additional configurations**
- This Project can not use React Native's new Architecture with Fabric rendrer because Reanimated v2 does not support the new architecure.

- The new reanimated v3 will support the new Architecture (Currently only RC version is available. I will wait for its Stable release). The RC version did not work out as it had a few Build errors (I tested with Reanimated v3.0.0-rc.2). To learn how to install Reanimated v3 [follow this link](https://blog.swmansion.com/announcing-reanimated-3-16167428c5f7)

- When the stable Reanimated v3 will roll out, I will update packages and enable the new Architecture.
